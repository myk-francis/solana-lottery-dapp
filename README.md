# 🎰 Lottery DApp (UI Starter)

A clean, full-screen **Lottery DApp UI** built with **Vite + React**, designed as a foundation for a **Solana-based lottery smart contract**.

At this stage, the project focuses on **UI and layout only**. All actions currently log to the console, making it easy to later integrate Solana programs without refactoring the interface.
